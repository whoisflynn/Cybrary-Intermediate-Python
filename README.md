# Cybrary-Intermediate-Python
Here's is a collection of scripts that go along with Cybrary's - Intermediate Python Course

There is a mismatch between the Module folders in this repo and the Module numbers in the viedos. The videos have the Modules numbered 1-4, and the course itself calls the Modules 1-3. Module 1 is an introductory video module.

For this repo, I have numbered to Modules 1-3 to match the course description

- Module 1: I/O
- Module 2: Classes
- Module 3: Modules

The course can be found at this URL: https://app.cybrary.it/browse/course/intermediate-python
